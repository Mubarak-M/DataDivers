# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset analysis
Use the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset to predict the outcome LBDHBG indicating HBV surface antigen (yes/no) from the dataset.

## Steps
*  Use the nhanes data to predict the outcome **LBDHBG** indicating HBV surface antigen (yes/no) from the above dataset.  
*  Data cleaning and preprocessing  
*  Fit logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models to predict LBDHBG  
*  Tune models to optimize performance
